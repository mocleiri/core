<p>With Wicket-Security 1.3.1 we are fixing the re usability of the sub projects, allowing you to use the same authentication / authorization framework in your soap calls as in your wicket application. In order to do that we drastically changed the way the projects were setup and we went from 2 projects (3 if you count the examples too) to 1 parent project with a total of 4 subprojects (not counting the examples).</p>
</div></div>

<h2><a name="Wicket-Security1.3.1-WiComSec"></a>WiComSec</h2>

<p>Wicket Common Security, or WiComSec for short, contains common classes / interfaces required by most subprojects. It has no runtime dependencies.</p>

<h2><a name="Wicket-Security1.3.1-WASP"></a>WASP</h2>

<p>Wicket Abstract Security Platform, or Wasp for short, contains the api and some secure components you can use. It has runtime dependencies on WiComSec, Wicket, SLF4J and optionally Wicket-Extensions.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="Wicket-Security1.3.1-Hive"></a>Hive</h2>

<p>Hive is just the name of this project, it does not mean anything like the other projects. Hive is a JAAS like security framework capable of supporting multiple security configuration in a single JVM. Its only runtime dependency is on WiComSec.</p>

<h2><a name="Wicket-Security1.3.1-SWARM"></a>SWARM</h2>

<p>Standard Wicket Authentication and Rights Management, or swarm for short, is the default implementation of Wasp. It has runtime dependencies on Wasp (and thus all its dependencies) and Hive.</p>

<h2><a name="Wicket-Security1.3.1-1.3.0compatability"></a>1.3.0 compatability</h2>

<p>We tried to keep the changes to both wasp and swarm api to a minimum but nonetheless 1.3.1 is not binary compatible with 1.3.0. We have compiled a list of changes here to ease the migration.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
	<li>ActionFactory#getAction(org.apache.wicket.authorization.Action) was moved to WaspActionFactory</li>
	<li>ActionFactory gained a method #getAction(org.apache.wicket.security.actions.WaspAction)</li>
	<li>org.apache.wicket.security.actions.WaspAction no longer extends org.apache.wicket.authorization.Action</li>
	<li>Subject#isClassAuthenticated(Class)<br/>
&#43;Subject#isComponentAuthenticated(Component)<br/>
&#43;Subject#isModelAuthenticated(IModel, Component) moved to a new interface org.apache.wicket.security.hive.authentication.WicketSubject</li>
	<li>The constructor for ActionPermission(String, String) is replaced by ActionPermission(String, WaspAction)</li>
	<li>org.apache.wicket.security.strategies.LoginException moved to a new package&nbsp; org.apache.wicket.security.authentication.LoginException</li>
	<li>${ComponentPermission} and ${DataPermission} are now registered as alias in SwarmPolicyFileHiveFactory, PolicyFileHiveFactory has no knowledge of them anymore.</li>
	<li>The constructor for PolicyFileHiveFactory() is replaced PolicyFileHiveFactory(ActionFactory)</li>
	<li>The constructor for SwarmActionFactory() is replaced by SwarmActionFactory(String)</li>
	<li>Primary means of locating an ActionFactory is now through the Actions singleton although the WaspApplication still provides a wrapper method to get the ActionFactory</li>
	<li>Constructors for ImpliesOtherAction are deprecated and replaced by 2 more simpler constructors requiring less knowledge of the internals</li>
</ul>


<p><a name="Wicket-Security1.3.1-migrateto1.3.1"></a>Unless you are building your own Wasp implementation you only have to think about 2 things when migrating your webapplication to 1.3.1</p>
<ul>
	<li>Instead of the PolicyFileHiveFactory you must now use the SwarmPolicyFileHiveFactory in SwarmWebApplication#setUpHive</li>
	<li>You have to change the import statement for the LoginException to: import org.apache.wicket.security.authentication.LoginException;</li>
</ul>
